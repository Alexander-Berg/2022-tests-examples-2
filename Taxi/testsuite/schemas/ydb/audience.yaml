# Adding or deleting users will be by ony one user identifier, so 
# there will be separate table for every user id type.

# There can be many records with one user identifier, so it can not be Primary Key.
# Identifier + campaign id is a unique combination, so it is PK.
# Identifiers will not be monotonously increasing, so they can be used in Key.

# Indexes by campaign id will be created to unpublish campaigns by campaign_id.
