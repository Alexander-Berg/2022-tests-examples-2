description: Car license plate validation by country. The key should be the id of
    the country, the value is a dictionary, which consists of 'formats' (an array
    of strings with allowed car license plate formats, not required to fill) and 'allowed_letters'
    (an array of letters, which are allowed in car license plate, required to fill).
    Digits and hyphen are already included in 'allowed_letters'. If the country is
    not present, then the format is not checked. Only uppercase Latin letters are
    allowed (you can write any in place of letters in the license plate), also digits
    and hyphens If you don't know the id of your country, then it is better to clarify
    it. For all questions, please contact `amaxacla@`
